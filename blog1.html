    <h1>My First Internship as a Frontend Developer</h1>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> GBCS Group</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 months, remote</p>

    <p>When I joined GBCS Group as a frontend intern, I had no idea how fast things would move. I was part of a 20-person intern team tasked with building and debugging internal platforms. We used React, Node.js, and Next.js—technologies. I’d studied these before, but now I was using them in real-world projects, with real deadlines, and real expectations.</p>

    <p> I began working closely with our project manager to write clear documentation for our internal and external sites. Over time, I took on more responsibility and eventually became the team lead. That meant coordinating tasks, mentoring other interns, and even leading our weekly meetings.</p>

    <p>Over the course of the summer, I got to see how a tech team operates from the inside, and I walked away with stronger skills, deeper confidence, and a clearer sense of how I want to grow as a developer.</p>

    <p>This internship wasn’t just about writing code—it was about learning how to lead, collaborate, and build something that matters!</p>
