    <h1>My First Internship as a Frontend Developer</h1>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> GBCS Group</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 months, remote</p>

    <p>When I joined GBCS Group as a frontend intern, I had no idea how fast things would move. I was part of a 20-person intern team tasked with building internal platforms to support fleet optimization operations. We used React, Node.js, and Next.js—technologies I’d studied before, but now I was using them in real-world projects, with real deadlines, and real expectations.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite parts was working closely with our project manager. I learned how to write clear documentation, manage feature rollouts, and communicate technical decisions. Over time, I took on more responsibility and eventually became the team lead. That meant coordinating tasks, mentoring other interns, and even leading our weekly meetings with the CEO.</p>

    <p>It was intense, but incredibly rewarding. I got to see how a tech team operates from the inside, and I walked away with stronger skills, deeper confidence, and a clearer sense of how I want to grow as a developer.</p>

    <p>This internship wasn’t just about writing code—it was about learning how to lead, collaborate, and build something that matters.</p>
